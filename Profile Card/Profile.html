            <p>As a passionate and driven software development fresher, I bring a strong foundation in C, C++, HTML, and
                CSS with additional knowledge in Java, Photoshop, and CorelDRAW. My academic background is complemented
                by a commitment to continuous learning and growth. I excel in communication, problem-solving, and
                teamwork, with proven leadership experience from managing mini and final year projects, including job
                allocation, financial management, and team coordination. My short-term goal is to align with company
                needs, stay updated with industry trends, and contribute effectively. I value fairness and opportunities
                for all, aiming to foster a positive work environment and support team development.</p>
