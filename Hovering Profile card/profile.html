                <p>As a passionate and driven software development fresher, I bring a strong foundation in C, C++, HTML,
                    and CSS with additional knowledge in Java, Photoshop, and CorelDRAW. My academic background is
                    complemented by a commitment to continuous learning and growth. I excel in communication,
                    problem-solving, and teamwork, with proven leadership experience from managing mini and final year
                    projects, including job allocation, financial management, and team coordination. My short-term goal
                    is to align with company needs, stay updated with industry trends, and contribute effectively. I
                    value fairness and opportunities for all, aiming to foster a positive work environment and support
                    team development.</p>
